# Problem statement

- How to accelerate the value stream of engineering teams
- How to quickly push new ideas to production
- How to adopt an application centric workflow to decrease the cycle time
- How to enable a smooth communication between engineering teams and platform ones

---

# Multiple tools / solutions

- Internal Developer Platform
- Infrastructure as code libraries
- ðŸ‘‰ **Pipeline libraries** ðŸ‘ˆ

---

# Why create a pipeline library

- Decrease developer workload to push code to production
- Mutualize pipeline best practices across the company
  - DevSecOps
  - Compliance
  - Tests
- Break silos
- Improve cycle time

---

# Pipeline library development challenges

- KISS, Keep It Simple & Stupid
- Avoid the one size fits all solution
- Create a portable library (avoid orchestrator lock-in)
- Enable productivity by allowing job local execution

---

# What problems Dagger address

By using a container approach, Dagger solved the following issues :

- ðŸ‘‰ **Create a portable library (avoid orchestrator locking)** ðŸ‘ˆ
- ðŸ‘‰ **Enable productivity by allowing job local execution** ðŸ‘ˆ

# History

- First line of code in **December 2020** by **Solomon Hykes**'team (ex-docker)
- **Independent** and **agnostic** of any language
- **Can be used locally**

<!--
Dagger is portable and compatible

# How does it work

![bg left 70%](assets/dagger.drawio.png)

- *Plan*: Contain actions
- *Actions*: Define jobs to execute
- *Clients*: Interact with the underlying operating system
- *Secrets*: Store sensitive data

# Use case

![bg right:50% w:100%](assets/pipeline.png)

A simple pipeline to build the presentation slides.

3 steps:

- ðŸ‘‰ **lint** ðŸ‘ˆ
- ðŸ‘‰ **build** ðŸ‘ˆ
- deploy

# All start with a **Plan**

<!-- ![bg left fit](assets/loves-plan-together.jpeg) -->

![bg right fit](assets/dagger-plan.png)

---

# Import dependencies

![bg left fit](assets/dagger-import.png)

- Centrally develop common actions
- Speed up pipeline creation by mutualizing / reusing code
- Compose pipeline from reusable actions

---

# Lint action
