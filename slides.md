# Problem statement

- How to accelerate the value stream of engineering teams
- How to quickly push new ideas to production
- How to adopt an application centric workflow to decrease the cycle time
- How to enable a smooth communication between engineering teams and platform ones

---

# Multiple tools / solutions

- Internal Developer Platform
- Infrastructure as code libraries
- ðŸ‘‰ **Pipeline libraries** ðŸ‘ˆ

---

# Why create a pipeline library

- Decrease developer workload to push code to production
- Mutualize pipeline best practices across the company
  - DevSecOps
  - Compliance
  - Tests
- Break silos
- Improve cycle time

---

# Pipeline library development challenges

- KISS, Keep It Simple & Stupid
- Avoid the one size fits all solution
- Create a portable library (avoid orchestrator lock-in)
- Enable productivity by allowing job local execution

---

# What problems Dagger address

By using a container approach, Dagger solved the following issues :

- ðŸ‘‰ **Create a portable library (avoid orchestrator locking)** ðŸ‘ˆ
- ðŸ‘‰ **Enable productivity by allowing job local execution** ðŸ‘ˆ

# History

- First line of code in **December 2020** by **Solomon Hykes**'team (ex-docker)
- **Independent** and **agnostic** of any language
- **Can be used locally**

<!--
Dagger is portable and compatible

# How does it work

![bg left 70%](assets/dagger.drawio.png)

- *Plan*: Contain actions
- *Actions*: Define jobs to execute
- *Clients*: Interact with the underlying operating system
- *Secrets*: Store sensitive data
